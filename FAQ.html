      <details>
        <summary><b>Question 11:</b> What are the main features of the schemes under NSAP?</summary>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> Some of the important features of the schemes are as follows:</p>
        <ol type="a" style="padding-inline-start: 40px;">
          <li><b>Selection :</b><br />
            The Gram Panchayat/Municipalities are expected to play an active role in the identification of the beneficiaries under the three schemes.</li>
          <li><b>Disbursement :</b><br />
            Apart from the disbursal of benefits through the accounts of the beneficiaries in Banks or in Post Office Savings Banks or through Postal Money Order the assistance under the Old Age Pension Scheme, may also be disbursed in public meetings such as Gram Sabha meetings in rural areas and by neighbourhood/ mohalla committees in urban areas. Recently it has been decided by  the Govt. of India to credit pension  where feasible,  into a post office or public sector bank account of the beneficiary.</li>
          <li><b>Monitoring :</b><br />
            The States/UTs have the flexibility to implement the schemes through any State Govt. Department. They have to however, designate a Nodal Secretary at the State level to report the progress of implementation by coordinating with different departments concerned with the implementation of the schemes. The progress of implementation of the schemes is to be reported through quarterly reports in a given monitoring format by the 15th of month of the following quarter. Non reporting of the physical and financial progress reports is construed as lack of progress and therefore, may result in the non-release of additional central assistance for the last quarter of the financial year. Since the ACA allocations for the schemes lapse at the end of the financial year, the instalments cannot be released during the next financial year, even if a State Govt. reports progress subsequent to the cut-off dates fixed as above.</li>
        </ol>

      <details>
        <summary><b>Question 12:</b> What is the eligibility for getting pension under IGNOAPS?</summary>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> The eligibility criteria under Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS) is:-</p>
        <ul style="padding-inline-start: 40px;">

          <li>The applicant should belong to a household living below the poverty line according to the criteria prescribed by the Govt. of India</li>
        </ul></p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><b>Question 13:</b> How is IGNOAPS different from the earlier National Old Age Peneion Scheme (NOAPS)?</summary>
        <p><b>Answer:</b> Under NOAPS, old age pension were granted to a person who is 65 years old or higher and who is destitute in the sense of having little or no means of regular income. Pension under IGNOAPS is now granted to a person who is 60 years or above and belongs to a household below the poverty line instead of only to destitute.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
